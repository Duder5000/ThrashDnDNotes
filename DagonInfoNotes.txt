Obyrith entering the Forgotten Realms universe
so you know things from other universes can come in to this one
the creation of the abyss
the whole thing about the shard of evil and tharizdun

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I was built by a monster, to do his bidding.
Then remade by an ancient, to be an extension of its will.
Until the other day, I'd never made a meaningful choice for myself.
I know I made a choice that most of not all of you disagree with, but I made the best decision I could with the information I had.
It may turn out to be the bad one, but that is the risk of having the ability to choose.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I was first built as this, a minion of the Prince of Pleasure.
Then when you all freed me from his machinations, I was remade by Dagon to carry out his will, without any memories of my past.
After having my memory restored by the very being that took it from me, I was offered a choose. 
I may not of been certain of my choice because I knew you all disapproved & my opinions do matter to me, but I made the choice choose I did. 
The first real choose of my life.
Now I am certain of my choice, Dagon has shown so much of the universe. I no longer need faith that his path is for the best, I know it to be true.
And it pains me every moment that I cannot explain why to you. Mere words are not enough and if I were to show  you what I have seen, it would destroy you mind.
