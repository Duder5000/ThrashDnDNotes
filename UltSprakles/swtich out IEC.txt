**Gorgon Cybernetics**
Gorgon has been bringing in their new full-borg for testing by MaxTac via the Archangels
They have also been smugling in cyberware for the Metal Warriors, their leader is an ex-Ranger
The hope is that some MaxTac operators will switch to Cherubael, so that they have field testing to show to Texas Peacekeeping Command (TPC)
On of their corp spy (netrunner) at Seward Entertainment was looking for info IEC reaseach, found project Helljummer which was abandoned by IEC b/c they could figure out a way to test it without the ESA finding out
Goron has funded a small corp (named Carbon Skies, makes dispoable comabt drones for the militaties of South America & part of the EEC) out of Brasil that has been developing large scale cloaking 
	Cloak only effective on human sized objects (Eclipes full-body) & slow moving vechiles 

**Old Comabt Zone Show - Tavel Home REDUX**
	-The Plan: Drive home
	-Complecations: IEC merc waiting at the appratment (Solo & Medtech in apartment, netrunner in a NCPD car out front, checking face scans)
		-Offer: Give back the data & we'll let you live with our chipeware install so you dont mis-behave OR I'll let Helmet (German medtech in black Trama Team gear) have a chat with you while I look for it.
	-Deus Ex Machina (if only Lyssa & Sparkles): Corp spy (netrunner) from Seward has been following the IEC mercs, quick hack to disable the solo's eyes & Goop bomb (pg 375) at the MedTech, tells them to run
		-Make the spy Mantis (Lyssa's runner friend that tipped them off to Seward)???

**Arizona**
	Arizona is almost entierly a desert & is ruled by clans of Cyber-Barbarians.
	The Cyber-Barbarians are constantly waring with each other & anyone else that just so happens to be passing through.
	The Cyber-barbarians clans have lots of street borgs addicted to Blue Ice to function.
	Clans of Cyber-Barbarians (which change almost weekly) control the only effective routes through Arizona. If you're avoiding these routes, you'll need an AV, hover vechile, or an imporved off-road vechile to make it accross the dunes. When a sand storm hits, scrap & pollution in the storm reduces vision to almost 0 & confuzes sensors & GPS.
	The Archangels have an understanding with the strong clans & can easily fight off the smaller clans at attack them.

	Most Powerful Clans:
		-Legio Mortis (Death Knights):
			-https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Legio_Mortis
			-Clan of ACPA pilots
			-Most civil of the clans, no Cyberpsychos, can be negotiated with 
			-Durig the outbreak of the 4th corp war, police & construction APCA operators decided to band together and from a Nomad-like clan in the Arizona desert.  
		-Iron Circle:
			-https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Iron_Circle
			-Roving band of biped drones protecting some at its center.
			-A single Netrunner (plus some demons) with lots of Cyberware controls several walker drones
			-Each walker is connected to a portable net on drones flying above.
			-The netrunner (freelancer) got their brain fired during by another netrunner during the 3rd corp war, couldn't find runner work b/c they were erattic, so they hacked a whole bunch of Arasaka biped drones during the out break of the 4th corp war & fleed Arizona.

		-Skitarii:
			-https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Skitarii
			-Clan made up enterly of 'street borgs'
			-They worship the machine god & clam to fight off cyberpsycos through his worship.
			-Tech-Priests approve & install all the holy cyberware.
			-Lower class clan members have less cyberware.
			-Advise form Archangels: "If you run into them, have whoever has the most Cyberware up front & praise the Machine God."
			-There home is Alpha, until around a year ago its contence was unknowen, but recently Missionaries of the Machine God have been spreading through out the Cyber-Barbarians clans.
				-Alpha: A domed city which envelops the Horseshoe Dam northeast of Phoenix, Alpha remains a mystery. It is a sealed environment, and no one knows any outsiders who have been inside the enclosure. Observers point out that Alpha has been built on the research of previous self-sustaining colonies, like the Bio 1 experiments. In fact, the only thing Alpha imports (as near as anyone can tell) is hydroelectric power. Is Alpha a threat? No one knows.

**New Mexico (pg.142)**
	-Military training, weapons testing, mining
