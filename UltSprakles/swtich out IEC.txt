Gorgon has been bringing in their new full-borg for testing by MaxTac via the Archangels
	They have also been smugling in cyberware for the Metal Warriors, their leader is an ex-Ranger
	The hope is that some MaxTac operators will switch to Cherubael, so that they have field testing to show to Texas Peacekeeping Command (TPC)
	On of their corp spy (netrunner) at Seward Entertainment was looking for info IEC reaseach, found project Helljummer which was abandoned by IEC b/c they could figure out a way to test it without the ESA finding out
	Goron has funded a small corp (named Carbon Skies, makes dispoable comabt drones for the militaties of South America & part of the EEC) out of Brasil that has been developing large scale cloaking 
		Cloak only effective on human sized objects (Eclipes full-body) & slow moving vechiles

Primary cyber-barbarians of Arizona
	Arizona has been given over to the cyber-barbarians, filled violent barbarians-like clans that are constatnly waring with each other
	The cyber-barbarians control the only effective routes between cities, need an AV, hover vechile, or heavly modifed off-road vechile to make it on another route. It is also the most direct route which is why the Archangels use it, but they have an understanding with the cyber-barbarians.

	**Iron Circle**
		-A single Netrunner (& some demons?) with lots of Cyberware controls several walker drones
