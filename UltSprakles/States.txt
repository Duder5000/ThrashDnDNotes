**Arizona (p.139)**
	Arizona is almost entierly a desert & is ruled by clans of Cyber-Barbarians.
	The Cyber-Barbarians are constantly waring with each other & anyone else that just so happens to be passing through.
	The Cyber-barbarians clans have lots of street borgs addicted to Blue Ice to function.
	Clans of Cyber-Barbarians (which change almost weekly) control the only effective routes through Arizona. If you're avoiding these routes, you'll need an AV, hover vechile, or an imporved off-road vechile to make it accross the dunes. When a sand storm hits, scrap & pollution in the storm reduces vision to almost 0 & confuzes sensors & GPS.
	The Archangels have an understanding with the strong clans & can easily fight off the smaller clans at attack them.

	Most Powerful Clans:
		-Bellator Machina (Warrior Machine):

				-Alpha: A domed city which envelops the Horseshoe Dam northeast of Phoenix, Alpha remains a mystery. It is a sealed environment, and no one knows any outsiders who have been inside the enclosure. Observers point out that Alpha has been built on the research of previous self-sustaining colonies, like the Bio 1 experiments. In fact, the only thing Alpha imports (as near as anyone can tell) is hydroelectric power. Is Alpha a threat? No one knows.
