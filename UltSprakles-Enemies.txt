**Axle Backstory**
	Now unlike his previous role of dealing with getting people stable this was more of a treatment idea where he would start to install cybernetics to try to help them get back to living normal-ish life. As the cyberwear improved, so did Axel’s ideas. He eventually began doing work for some of the locals and even started using some not “military cyberwear” on people to test it out and make some money on the side. 
	One day when conducting a transport his convoy hit an IED and the next thing he remembers was waking up in the same hospital that he spent so long working in with a new very low quality cyberarm in the place of his left arm. As he went to check on this arm he noticed that his other hand was handcuffed to the hospital bed. 
	Apparently while he was unconscious there was an audit of some of the devices that had been used and slowly his unauthorized surgeries began to come to light. 
	He was eventually kicked out of the military with a dishonorable discharge and sent to live on the streets. The only saving grace was the little bit of money that he managed to hide away from the military that allowed him the chance to buy some equipment and upgrade his arm and he even opened his own clinic. 
	While this clinic was not exactly board certified, he was willing to do any work that was asked of him, for the right price.
