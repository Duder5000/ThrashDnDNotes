**Axle Backstory**
	Axel Everheart grew up in a mess of a house, his father took no shit from him and would regularly beat him if he did not do his chores on time or if he even looked in the wrong direction. He was a child who spent most of his time tending to his own wounds while listening to his parents argue or make strange noises in the bedroom next to his. Oftentimes his parents would leave and leave him with his grandparents who were much nicer to him. They would buy him food, take him to sports games, and help him with homework. When he was there he was happy. One day when Axel was in his mid-teens he got the word that his grandparents were in a car crash and did not make it. Pushing him over the edge he dove into the world of drugs. Taking whatever he could to try to get past the pain he slowly destroyed his life all while his father continued to take out his rough days on him with anything from a cigarette butt to a belt that he could swing faster than most bats. That is until one day he met the man that would change his life for what he had thought would be the better. When that New USA Army recruiter pulled him out of the gutter after one too many long nights and offered him a place in the ranks if he could just stay clean Axel had nothing to do but say yes. Knowing this would take him from his horrible home life and give him a reason to live he followed his treatment plan and before he knew it on his 17th birthday he signed the contract and shipped out to basic training later that week. 
	During basic training he naturally took to tending to other people’s wounds and helping them to heal making him the ideal candidate for a combat medic. He could withstand lots of pain and stress and still focus on helping other people. Deployment after deployment he began to hone his skills both in killing and in treating until he got the position on a base as their primary medic. Now unlike his previous role of dealing with getting people stable this was more of a treatment idea where he would start to install cybernetics to try to help them get back to living normal-ish life. As the cyberwear improved, so did Axel’s ideas. He eventually began doing work for some of the locals and even started using some not “military cyberwear” on people to test it out and make some money on the side. One day when conducting a transport his convoy hit an IED and the next thing he remembers was waking up in the same hospital that he spent so long working in with a new very low quality cyberarm in the place of his left arm. As he went to check on this arm he noticed that his other hand was handcuffed to the hospital bed. Apparently while he was unconscious there was an audit of some of the devices that had been used and slowly his unauthorized surgeries began to come to light. He was eventually kicked out of the military with a dishonorable discharge and sent to live on the streets. The only saving grace was the little bit of money that he managed to hide away from the military that allowed him the chance to buy some equipment and upgrade his arm and he even opened his own clinic. While this clinic was not exactly board certified, he was willing to do any work that was asked of him, for the right price.
